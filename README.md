To use the code, first clone the application using following command
```
git clone https://github.com/RushabhaJain/VideoProcessing.git
```

The application is built on Golang, so in order to use it please make sure Go Runtime is installed on your machine.

The application is also using AssemblyAI (used to convert .mp3 to .srt) file, so we require the API_KEY of that and add that API_KEY in .env file

To run the application, use following command:
```
go run .
```
